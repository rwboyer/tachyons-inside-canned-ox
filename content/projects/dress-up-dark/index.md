Everything from first frame exposure test to last attempt at movement in a limited space. **SOOC** is photographer jargon that simply means *"strait out of camera"*. Our primary product is photographic image assets. We love photography and respect all aspects of the image making process. While post processing and various *treatments* are common place now and certainly play a role in the final product we stronly believe in starting with a strong foundation. If an image doesn't work before all of the post production polish it's not going to work that well afterwards. Beyond that the simple strait-forward photograph holds a special place in our hearts.
